============================

Welcome to the source code for Android testing examples from the vogella.com online tutorials and books.

Using with Android Studio
=======================

All projects should have a `build.gradle` file suitable for
importing the project into Android Studio. If not please send a pull request to add one.

Note, though, that you
may need to adjust the `compileSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` if it
requests an SDK that you have not downloaded and do not wish to
download. Similarly, you may need to adjust the `buildToolsVersion`
value to refer to a version of the "Build-tools" that you have downloaded
from the SDK Manager.

Using with Eclipse
================

The Eclipse IDE is currenty not supported, as Google does not provide support for the usage of Gradle with Eclipse.
